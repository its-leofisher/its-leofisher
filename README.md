Love to create and learn web related technologies and systems.  Experienced in small to large frameworks with, but not limited to, Laravel, Magento, Odoo (ERP), and WooCommerce.  Using my experience to extend and architect software systems, plan and optimize RDMS, and create API connections between applications.  Understand OOP and MVC patterns ensuring proper abstractions between Frontend and Backend separation of concerns.
