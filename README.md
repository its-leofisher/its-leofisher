### 👋

I create software with web technologies.  Experienced with small to large frameworks, not limited to: Laravel, Magento, Odoo (ERP), Shopify and WooCommerce.  Using my experience to architect and extend software systems, improve and make new processess, plan and optimize RDMS, and create API connections between them.  I understand OOP and MVC patterns ensuring proper abstractions between Frontend and Backend separation of concerns.

When facing difficult challenges, this mantra helps me remember to come back:
