### ðŸ‘‹

I create with web technologies and systems.  Experienced with small to large frameworks, not limited to: Laravel, Magento, Odoo (ERP), Shopify and WooCommerce.  Using my experience to extend and architect software systems, plan and optimize RDMS, and create API connections between applications.  I understand OOP and MVC patterns ensuring proper abstractions between Frontend and Backend separation of concerns.
